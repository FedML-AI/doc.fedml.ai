# FEDML Storage APIs

## Storage APIs

Storage APIs help in managing all the data needs that is typically associated with AI workloads.

:::tip
Before using some of the apis that require remote operation (e.g. `fedml.api.launch_job()`), please use one of the following methods to login 
to FedML MLOps platform first:

1. CLI: `fedml login $api_key`

2. API: `fedml.api.fedml_login(api_key=$api_key)`
:::

### `fedml.api.upload()`

Upload data on FEDML® Nexus AI Platform

```py
def upload(data_path, api_key=None, service="R2", name=None, description=None, metadata=None, show_progress=False,
           out_progress_to_err=True, progress_desc=None)-> FedMLResponse
```

**Arguments**

- `data_path (str)`: path to the data.
- `api_key (str=None)`: Your API key from FedML AI Nexus platform (if not configured already).
- `service (str)`: The backend cloud storage service for storing the data. Currently, only Cloudfare R2 service is available.
- `name (str)`: The name of the data stored on the cloud. If not specified, it'll take the name of the data file or directory.
- `description (str)`: A description in string for the data being stored. If not provided, the description will be empty.
- `metadata (dict)`: Metadata for the data that can be specified by the user in the form of a dictionary. Both the key and values have to be strings.
- `show_progress (bool)`: Boolean flag to show a progress bar when the upload happens.
- `out_progress_to_err (bool)`: Boolean flag to output the tqdm progress to stderr instead of stdout.
- `progress_desc(str)`: String message that is displayed next to the progress bar when the data is uploaded. If not specified, the text : "Uploading Package to Remote Storage" will be used.

**Returns**

`FedMLResponse` object with the following attributes:
- `code (Enum Class)`: API result code. The FedML response codes can be seen at the end of this page.
- `message (str)`: API status message.
- `data(obj)`: If the upload is successful, the url of the uploaded file is sent via this attribute.


**Example**

```py
import fedml
API_KEY = "api_key"

DATA_PATH = "path/to/data"
DATA_NAME = "new_name_for_data_directory or file"
STORAGE_SERVICE = "R2"
DATA_DESCRIPTION = "description of data uploaded"
metadata = {'key': 'value'}

response = fedml.api.upload(
    data_path=DATA_PATH,
    api_key=API_KEY,
    service=STORAGE_SERVICE,
    name=DATA_NAME,
