# What is FEDML® Federate?

FedML® Federate is a core technology of the FEDML® Nexus AI platform, which:

- enables **zero-code, lightweight, cross-platform, and provably secure** Federated Learning (FL) and Analytics (FA).
- operates **without data centralization** and enables **decentralized machine learning** over distributed data silos.
- consists of a **lightweight & cross-platform Edge AI SDK** deployable over edge GPUs, smartphones, and IoT devices.
- provides a **user-friendly MLOps platform** to simplify decentralized execution and real-world deployment. 


The FedML logo reflects the mission of FedML Inc. We aim to build simple and versatile APIs for machine learning running anywhere and at any scale. In other words, FedML supports both federated learning for data silos and distributed training for acceleration with MLOps and Open Source support, covering both cutting-edge academia research and industrial grade use cases. 

The FEDML® Federate core functionalities are represented through the following four components: **Cheetah** for accelerated ML model training, **Octopus** for cross-silo federated settings, **Parrot** for simulated federated settings, **BeeHive** for cross-device federated settings

By allowing data to remain at their original source, FedML® Federate maximizes data privacy and security. FedML® Federate supports vertical solutions across a broad range of industries (healthcare, finance, insurance, smart cities, IoT, etc.) and applications (computer vision, natural language processing, data mining, time-series forecasting, etc.). The execution engine of FedML® Federate is backed by many years of [state-of-the-art research](tech/papers.md).
