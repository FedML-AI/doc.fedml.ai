# What is FEDML® Federate?

FedML® Federate is a core technology of the FEDML® Nexus AI platform, which:

- enables **zero-code, lightweight, cross-platform, and provably secure** Federated Learning (FL) and Analytics (FA).
- operates **without data centralization** and enables **decentralized machine learning** over distributed data silos.
- consists of a **lightweight & cross-platform Edge AI SDK** deployable over edge GPUs, smartphones, and IoT devices.
- provides a **user-friendly MLOps platform** to simplify decentralized execution and real-world deployment. 

The four computational pillars of FEDML® Federate are: **Cheetah** for accelerated ML model training, **Octopus** for cross-silo federated settings, **Parrot** for simulated federated settings, **BeeHive** for cross-device federated settings.

By allowing data to remain at their original source, FedML® Federate maximizes data privacy and security. FedML® Federate supports vertical solutions across a broad range of industries (healthcare, finance, insurance, smart cities, IoT, etc.) and applications (computer vision, natural language processing, data mining, time-series forecasting, etc.). The execution engine of FedML® Federate is backed by many years of [state-of-the-art research](outreach/outreach.md).
