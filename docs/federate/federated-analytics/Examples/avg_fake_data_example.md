# AVG


This example demonstrates how to complete an average analytics task using local data from multiple clients. The source code locates at [[link]](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/tree/master/python/examples/federated_analytics/avg_fake_data_example). As an example, we utilize a fake dataset containing 10,000 integers, uniformly sampled from 0 to 100.


> **If you have multiple nodes, you should run the client script on each node**

## APIs

The highly encapsulated server and client API calls are shown as below:

`run_server.sh` is as follows:



```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

RUN_ID=$1
python3 server.py --cf fedml_config.yaml --rank 0 --role server --run_id $RUN_ID
```

`server.py` is as follows:

```python
from fedml.fa import init, FARunner
from fedml.fa.data import fa_load_data


if __name__ == "__main__":
    args = init()
    dataset = fa_load_data(args)
    fa_runner = FARunner(args, dataset)
    fa_runner.run()
```

`run_client.sh` is as follows:


```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash
RANK=$1
RUN_ID=$2
python3 client.py --cf fedml_config.yaml --rank $RANK --role client --run_id $RUN_ID
```

`client.py` is as follows:

```python
from fedml.fa import init, FARunner
from fedml.fa.data import fa_load_data

if __name__ == "__main__":
    args = init()
    dataset = fa_load_data(args)
    fa_runner = FARunner(args, dataset)
    fa_runner.run()
```

At the client side, the client ID (a.k.a rank) starts from 1. Please also modify fedml_config.yaml, changing the `client_num_in_total` the as the number of clients you plan to run.

At the server side, run the following script:
```
bash run_server.sh a
```

For client 1, run the following script:
```
bash run_client.sh 1 a
```
For client 2, run the following script:
```
bash run_client.sh 2 a
```



`fedml_config.yaml` is shown below.

```yaml
common_args:
  training_type: "cross_silo"
  random_seed: 0

data_args:
  dataset: "fake"
  data_cache_dir: ~/fedml_data

train_args:
  client_num_in_total: 2
  client_num_per_round: 2
  comm_round: 10
  fa_task: "AVG"

comm_args:
  backend: "MQTT_S3"
```
