# Overview

Federated analytics (FA) is a privacy-preserving framework
for computing data analytics over multiple remote parties
(e.g., mobile devices) or silo-ed institutional entities (e.g.,
hospitals, banks) without sharing the data among parties.
Motivated by the practical use cases of federated analytics,
we follow a systematic discussion on federated analytics in
the following article. In particular, we discuss the unique characteristics of federated analytics and how it differs from federated
learning. We also explore a wide range of FA queries and
discuss various existing solutions and potential use case applications for different FA queries.

FEDMLÂ®Federate Federated analytics (FA) is the industrial grade library of cross-silo federated analytics for cross-organization/account analytics. 
Researchers and engineers do not need to maintain the complex geo-distributed clusters.
Essentially, Our MLOps can seamlessly migrate the local development to the real-world edge-cloud deployment without code changes.
