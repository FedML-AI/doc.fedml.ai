# What is TensorOpera Workflow?

As the AI space continuously evolves, so does the technical complexity of supporting emerging AI tools. New requirements are introduced requiring complex system designs and data flows that allow to combine ad-hoc data and model pipelines into cohesive workflows. Some typical AI workflows include:

1. Model deployment workflows starting from data gathering and pre-processing to model training and evaluation.
2. Compound AI workflows tying together pipelines from different data and models.

This is where the TensorOpera Workflow API becomes essential. The Workflow API offers an intuitive general-purpose interface to outline system components, tasks and their interdependencies.
