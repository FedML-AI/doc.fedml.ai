# Quickstart
### Prerequisites
Install TensorOpera library on your machine
```bash
pip install fedml
```
### Create a model from Hugging Face
Use `fedml model create` command to create a model. For options, use `-n` to indicate the model card name, 
then use `-m` to indicate a pre-built model.  

In this quick start example, we will try
to deploy an `EleutherAI/pythia-70m` model from Hugging Face. To use a hugging face model, you will need to
use `hf:` as the prefix of the model name. So the full model name is `hf:EleutherAI/pythia-70m`.

```bash
fedml model create -n hf_model -m hf:EleutherAI/pythia-70m
```
### Deploy the model to the local machine
Use `fedml model deploy` command to deploy the model. Use `-n` to indicate the model card name.
To deploy to the local machine, use `--local` option.
```bash
fedml model deploy -n hf_model --local
```
:::info

Above command will:  
1. Automatically download and install the dependencies for inference.  
2. Download the model weights from Hugging Face.
3. Start the model inference server and listen to localhost:2345/predict for requests.

```
:::

Use a `curl` command to test the inference server.
```bash
curl -XPOST localhost:2345/predict -d '{"text": "Hello"}'
```


:::info
You should see the output from the terminal with the response of that model.
```
"{'generated_text': '...'}"
```

### Deploy the model to Serverless GPU cloud
:::note
Before you start, you will need to create an account on [TensorOpera AI](https://TensorOpera.ai/home).
After you create an account, you will see an Account Key (API Key) from the profile page.

Next you need to bind your credit card to your account. This is required to use the GPU cloud.

:::

Use `fedml login $api_key` to login to TensorOpera AI Cloud. Replace `$api_key` with your own API key.
```bash
fedml login $api_key
```
Use `fedml model deploy` command to deploy the model. Use `-n` to indicate the model card name.
```bash
fedml model deploy -n hf_model
```
