## 2. Add GPUs

### 2.1) Prerequisites:
Need to have a GPU server with NVIDIA GPU(s) installed and CUDA drivers installed.
To check if nvidia drivers are installed, run the following command:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

If you see the output with GPU details, you are good to go.

If you don't have nvidia drivers installed, you can first try to install them using the following command:

```bash
sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
sudo reboot
nvidia-smi
```

If the above commands don't work, you can follow the instructions on NVIDIA's official website
[here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html).

### 2.2) Execute the following binding script on your GPU server:

```bash
sudo curl -sSf https://doc.fedml.ai/shell/bind_gpu.sh | bash && exec $SHELL && sudo curl -sSf https://doc.fedml.ai/shell/verify_installation.sh | bash
```

This script will install the fedml library and all required dependencies on your GPU server.

### 2.3) Verify the environment setup on your GPU server:

#### Verify the installation of fedml library on your GPU server:

```bash
fedml env
```

The output should look like below:

```bash
(fedml) ubuntu@fedml-a100-deploy:~$ fedml env

======== FedML (https://fedml.ai) ========
FedML version: 0.8.26
FedML ENV version: release
Execution path:/home/ubuntu/miniconda3/envs/fedml/lib/python3.10/site-packages/fedml/__init__.py

======== Running Environment ========

======== Network Connection Checking ========
The connection to https://open.fedml.ai is OK.

The connection to S3 Object Storage is OK.

The connection to mqtt.fedml.ai (port:1883) is OK.
```

#### Verify the installation of fedml library on your GPU server:
```bash
(base) DGX-7% docker ps
CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND  CREATED  STATUS  PORTS  NAMES```
```

Execute two commands given below to re-start the docker daemon if you see the following error:
```
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
```

```bash
1. sudo su
2. systemctl start docker
````


### 2.4) Navigate to `Share & Earn / Add GPU` page and copy one-line login command for binding your GPU servers.

![Add GPU](static/image/add_gpu.png)

#### From your GPU server terminal, execute the login command copied in from the platform.

Below is output of command when executed on a FedMLÂ® GPU server:

```
(fedml) alay@a6000:~$ fedml login -p 3b24dd2f****************206e8669

 Welcome to FedML.ai!
 Start to login the current device to the FedMLÂ® Nexus AI Platform

(fedml) alay@a6000:~$

Congratulations, your device is connected to the FedML MLOps platform successfully!
Your FedML Edge ID is 1717367167533584384, unique device ID is 0xa11081eb21f1@Linux.Edge.GPU.Supplier

You may visit the following url to fill in more information with your device.
https://fedml.ai/gpu-supplier/gpu/edit/1717367167533584384
```

As instructed by the output, next you need to visit the url to fill in more information about your GPU server.


## 3. Fill in GPU server details


### 3.1) Navigate to `Share & Earn / My GPUs` page and click on the `Edit` button to fill in more information about your GPU servers.


:::tip Tip
You can also click through or copy the url link in the terminal output of previous step into browser of your choice to directly go to the edit page.

### 3.2) Fill in the details of your GPU server and click on `Update` button.

> **Note**: Most info is pre-filled for you. You just need to fill in the `GPU Name` and `Network Protocol` fields and set the cost per hour.

:::tip Tip
Be mindful while deciding Cost per hour for your GPU server. Setting the cost very high may put you at disadvantage as the matching algorithm prioritizes the cheaper GPU servers first.

![Update GPU](static/image/update_gpu.png)

Head back to the `Share & Earn / My GPUs` page on platform and verify that the GPU server is added to your list of active GPUs:

## 4. Sit back, relax and get paid by FedML, Inc.

Hard part is over, now comes the fun part.

Your GPU server will automatically be added to the resource pool and jobs that match the specifications will be scheduled.
